==============

Writeme is a PyPI package that searches through a user's codebase, and uses filepaths, docstrings, web framework specifications, installed requirements, and other user-added data to generate a README.md file.  

This package was written as a project by students at Code Fellows, Seattle in December 2017.

To view the codebase or contribute, see project repo on `Github <http://www.github.com/chelseadole/>`_
