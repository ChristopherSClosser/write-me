Installation
*****

Prerequisites
==============

To use writeme, you must have:

 - `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
 - `Pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_

To ensure that you have these packages installed, execute the following on your commandline:

`pip --version`

and 

`python --version`

The output of both should be something like 'Python 3.6.3'. If running the `which` command returns nothing to the commandline, the package is not installed. In that case, download the packages using the instructions from the links above.
