Installation
************

Prerequisites
==============

To use write-me, you must have:

 - `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
 - `Pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_

To ensure that you have these packages installed, execute the following on your commandline:

``$ pip --version``
and 
``$ python --version``

The output of both should be something like 'Python 3.6.3'. If running the ``which`` command returns nothing to the commandline, the package is not installed. In that case, download the packages using the instructions from the links above. 

Installing write-me
===================

Now that you have Python and pip installed, you can proceed to installing write-me! As write-me is a PyPI package, it is pip installable. On the commandline, execute the following:

``$ pip install write-me``

If the installation is a success, the package will collect and install, and will end with the line:

``$ Successfully installed write-me-1.0``
