Description
==============

Write-me is a PyPI package that searches through a user's codebase, and uses filepaths, docstrings, web framework specifications, installed requirements, and other user-added data to generate a README.md file.  

This package was written as a project by students at Code Fellows, Seattle in December 2017.
